# Mini-Employee-List-Internship-Homework
ts the user click an employee to see more info (email and start date) – an alert(), modal, or expanding row is fine.
Has a search box to quickly find employees by name.
That’s it – no backend, no fancy build tools required.

Sample data
You can hard‑code an array in your JavaScript or load it from employees.json – whichever feels easier. Aim for 10 sample employees, e.g.:

{
  id: 1,
  name: "Lin Chang",
  title: "Marketing Assistant",
  email: "lin.chang@example.com",
  startDate: "2024-02-01"
}
2. Rules & Hints
Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks needed).
Keep your files small and well‑named (index.html, style.css, app.js).
Make sure the page still works on mobile (flexbox or grid is enough).
Write clean, readable code – comments welcome.
3. Creative Feature (Required)
Add one additional feature of your own design that improves the Employee List or delights the user. This could be a functional enhancement, a UX touch, a visual flourish, an insight dashboard—anything you believe adds real value.

Briefly describe your idea at the top of app.js or in a short paragraph in the README so we understand your thinking.

We leave this open‑ended on purpose to see how you think.

4. How to Submit
Fork this repo (or create a new public one).
Put your code inside – try to commit in logical steps.
Enable GitHub Pages (or use Netlify/Vercel) so we can see a live demo.
Send us the repo link and live URL before your deadline (7 days after you receive this task).
